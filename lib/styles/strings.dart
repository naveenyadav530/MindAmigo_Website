  static const String act2 = '''Now although this may seem counteractive, much of our struggle with poor mental health stems from avoidance. All too often we treat our negative thoughts and emotions as the enemy. which drives a constant battle that goes on in our mind.''';

This help us cultivate a more positive outlook on life, transforming how we feel for the better.''';
