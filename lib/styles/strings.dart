      '''The short answer is I’m not medically qualified and I don’t claim to be a psychologist, a psychiatrist or a neuroscientist, I’m just somebody who’s experienced poor mental health and come out the other end,
having learnt a lot about myself along the way.

My struggles with mental health all started in my teens and lasted into my early twenties. A lot of it was poor self esteem, where I criticised myself for not being good enough and that led to depression and anxiety.

I hated feeling the way I was and so I was looking for a way out. A remedy if you like, to change how I felt.

And that remedy doesn’t come in the form of some magic bullet. It took time to get some perspective on my life, to educate myself on the topic of mental wellbeing and to learn about the leading therapies in the field of psychology.

And knowing about the key therapies inside and out not only helped me understand my own emotions
better, but it also created a fundamental shift in the way I saw myself then and see myself now. 

Whilst it wasn’t an immediate revelation, what I learnt helped me see that depression and anxiety is not the enemy, it’s just part of being human. This shift also led to a significant change. I was no longer seeing my vulnerabilities as a sign of weakness or inadequacy. Did I need to know whether my depression was because of my low self esteem or was it my low self esteem causing my depression? At last I had begun to escape the cage I had built for myself.

Now these changes in perspective don’t happen over night; it does take time.
I sense you know this about your own life as well.

It’s a slow and steady march back to a better frame of mind. There’s no magic bullet, or one size fits all approach.

I created Mindamigo to help others on that journey of self discovery.
To give you the key insights and  techniques taken from the world’s leading therapies. 

I like to think of Mindamigo as an ‘all you can eat buffet’ of different
insights and techniques that you can pick and choose from. 

Some things will work for you and some things might not, but that’s okay, everyone’s different.

As I said previously, Mindamigo is not a magic bullet, but I guarantee there will be something
here that can help you get back on track and to focus on what really matters most to you.
