  static const String act2 = '''Now although this may seem counteractive, much of our struggle with poor mental health stems from avoidance. All too often we treat our negative thoughts and emotions as the enemy. which drives a constant battle that goes on in our mind.''';

  static const String cbt1 = '''Pioneered by Aaron T. Beck, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is based on the idea that our thoughts, emotions and behaviours all affect one another.''';

  static const String cbt2 = '''A critical thought about ourselves for instance, will create a negative change in our mood, and that change in mood, can subsequently affect how we behave, feeding back into our thoughts.''';
  static const String cbt3 = '''So with CBT, we learn to disentangle that cycle, by identifying and modifying distorted thinking\npatterns and behaviours, replacing them with a more objective perspective. This help us cultivate a more positive outlook on life, transforming how we feel for the better.''';
